I'm an active contributor to several open-source software packages, particularly [pymatgen](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen). See my [github page](https://github.com/utf) for more details.

### Open-Source Software

A brief overview of the open-source software packages I maintain are listed below:

[sumo](https://github.com/smtg-ucl/sumo): Heavyweight plotting tools for ab initio calculation data.

[materials-toolbox](https://github.com/utf/materials-toolbox): A collection of small python and bash scripts to help with computational chemistry work (especially for those using VASP).

[bapt](https://github.com/utf/bapt): A script to plot publication-ready electronic band alignment diagrams.

[galore](https://github.com/SMTG-UCL/galore): A package to apply Gaussian and Lorentzian broadening to data from *ab initio* calculations.
