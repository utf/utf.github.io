I'm an active contributor to several open-source software packages, particularly [pymatgen](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen),
[matminer](https://github.com/hackingmaterials/matminer), and [automatminer](https://github.com/hackingmaterials/automatminer).
See my [github page](https://github.com/utf) for more details.

### Open-Source Software

A brief overview of the open-source software packages I maintain are listed below:

[amset](https://github.com/hackingmaterials/amset): An efficient framework for calculating electron scattering rates from first principles.

[atomate](https://github.com/hackingmaterials/atomate): Computational workflows for high-throughput materials science.

[IFermi](https://github.com/fermisurfaces/IFermi): Tools for the generation, analysis and visualisation of Fermi surfaces.

[robocrystallographer](https://github.com/hackingmaterials/robocrystalloger): Crystal structure text descriptions and analysis.

[sumo](https://github.com/smtg-ucl/sumo): Heavyweight plotting tools for ab initio calculation data.

[galore](https://github.com/SMTG-UCL/galore): A package to apply Gaussian and Lorentzian broadening to data from *ab initio* calculations.

[materials-toolbox](https://github.com/utf/materials-toolbox): A collection of small python and bash scripts to help with computational chemistry work (especially for those using VASP).

[bapt](https://github.com/utf/bapt): A script to plot publication-ready electronic band alignment diagrams.
