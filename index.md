## Welcome

I'm an EPSRC Research Fellow at Imperial College London working on functinal materials design and discovery.
My current research involves using data science and machine learning to solve problems
in materials science. Most recently I've developed a [new framework](https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/amset/)
to calculate electron lifetimes from first principles. My PhD was focused on the discovery and analysis of energy materials
using first principles calculations. My research spans a broad range of applications, including
[photovoltaics](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2017/CC/C6CC06475B),
[thermoelectrics](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2020/mh/d0mh00197j/unauth#!divAbstract),
[transparent conductors](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2016/TC/C5TC04089B),
[covalent organic frameworks](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2016/CC/C6CC03895F),
and [singlet fission organics](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.9b06346).
