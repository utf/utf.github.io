## Welcome

I'm a final year EngD student in Computational Chemistry based at University
College London and Diamond Light Source. My research is focused on the
discovery and analysis of energy materials. I'm particularly interested in
[photovoltaics](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2017/CC/C6CC06475B)
and thermoelectrics but my research spans a broad range of applications, including
[transparent conductors](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2016/TC/C5TC04089B),
[covalent organic frameworks](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2016/CC/C6CC03895F),
and singlet fission organics.
