## Welcome

I'm a Postdoc at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory working on [The Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org).
My current research involves using data science and machine learning to solve problems
in materials science. Most recently I've developed a [new framework](https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/amset/)
to calculate electron lifetimes from first principles. My PhD was focused on the discovery and analysis of energy materials
using first principles calculations. My research spans a broad range of applications, including
[photovoltaics](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2017/CC/C6CC06475B),
[thermoelectrics](https://chemrxiv.org/articles/Computational_Discovery_of_Promising_New_n-type_Dopable_ABX_Zintl_Thermoelectric_Materials/11821497)
[transparent conductors](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2016/TC/C5TC04089B),
[covalent organic frameworks](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2016/CC/C6CC03895F),
and [singlet fission organics](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.9b06346).
