## Welcome

I'm a final year EngD student in Computational Chemistry based at University
College London and Diamond Light Source. My research is focussed on the 
discovery and analysis of new and existing materials for energy applications. 
Currently, I'm particularly interested in photovoltaics and thermoelectrics.
